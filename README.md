# Haven Container Configuration Examples

Haven allows storing of container configuration in Git repository (or in a config file) in YAML or properties formats. 
It lets the user quickly start (or scale) a new container without having to pass in the required settings every time. 
Configuration can vary for different clusters and image versions.
